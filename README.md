## What is XVNML2U
XVNML2U (XVNML To Unity), is a Unity Package that has the XVNML SCLA pre-built into the engine. It's a dedicated package that provides you will all the tools you need to implement story-based elements, as well as creating a Visual Novels.
XVNML in itself stands for the "X-Tensible Visual Novel Mark-Up Language". As the name suggests, it caters to those familiar with creating Visual Novels. Because it's also a mark-up language however, it's a perfect work around from using JSON files or creating your own Dialogue System and managing dialogues yourself.

## Why Should You Use XVNML and XVNML2U?
Visual Scripting solutions that exist inside Unity are great, and proves to be a solution that has a small barrier-of-entry of those not familiar with programming. However, mark-up languages have been known to provide that same barrier-of-entry, and you have all your content in a compact, easy-to-read format. Not only that, but you are not limited to the build-in features of XVNML and XVNML2U. Per the name, XVNML (and thus XVNML2U), allows you to add your own custom tags and macros, building on top the already-existing functionality that the XVNML SCLA provides.

XVNML2U is an example for that, as it was very easy to implement the XVNML SCLA into a game engine (such as Unity), and can equally be easy to implement the mark-up language in other engines and platforms. You could even create your own Unity Package by [implementing the XVNML SCLA yourself](https://github.com/Miijii-Kaichou/XVNML). You have control in what you create, thus all the power is given to you with XVNML and XVNML2U.

## XVNML2U Features
What's cool about it is both XVNML and XVNML2U is open-source, and yet very powerful. Other Visual Novel and Dialogue Systems exist on the Unity Asset Store. However, some does cost a pretty penny. This power is given to you right off the gate. You have access to 2 Toolkit objects, a Basic Toolkit, and a TOolkit more catered to creating Visual Novels, with it's own Stage Controller where you can have your characters come in and move, and perform Reactions. You'll also be given the power of creating your own Macros that controls the Stage Controller. Another feature include in this Unity Package is being about to create your own element tag, capable of performaning a desired action or function within your game that XVNML can't originally do. If you're really feeling ambitious, you can combine the powers of C# and XVNML to control properties in a C# script from an XVNML one, giving you everything you need to make a very intriguing and engaging Visual Novel, or implementing unique story elements into your game.


## How Do I Get Started
It's super easy! Considering that this package comes with dependencies needed to run the tool, including being compatible with DoTween, TextMeshPro, and Visual Studio Code, all it takes are a couple of steps. Clone this package, drag the package into your Unity Project, and import the assets needed. It even comes with a Demo Scene that goes more in depth with what you can do with XVNML (and in extension, XVNML2U). That's all there is to it.


## How Do I Contribute And Support The Development Of This Tool?
Considering that it's open-source, you should be able to submit an issue that exists within the tool. I'll do my best to patch up any issues that comes up as XVNML and XVNML2U continues development. You can also feel free to donate in hopes to implement more features into XVNML2U, such as a built-in dedicated XVNML editor with syntax highlight, intellisense, etc. We also plan on creating a dedicated Visual Novel Game Engine that combines a programming language with XVNML (those languages are to be determined, but the default will be XVNML with C# or Python). You could even contribute code into the project in hopes to make it better. This can also be applied with the XVNML SCLA (which its source code is avaliable to the public).
